# Allegory

Allegory is an advanced, terminal based interface for the Parable language. In addition to the core language it provides numerous extensions including console and file I/O functionality, host system interactions, and a library of loadable modules to further enhance the language.

## Architecture

Apologue bundles the Parable core, a precompiled snapshot of the standard library (with the basic set of extensions), and the Apologue support code into a single Python 3 compatible script.

## Usage Examples

To execute code in a file:

    ./allegory <filename>

For an interactive session:

    ./allegory
